I'm an Electronics Engineer student at USP, with a special interest towards AI and ML algorithms. I have currently published 2 papers on the ML field, which can be found in here under [Synthetic ECG Generation](https://github.com/Adelkend/Synthetic-ECG-Generation) and [SRNN](https://github.com/Adelkend/SRRNN). Both works have been published and accepted at the brazilian national symposium for signal processing (SBrT23/24), with the second one being commended the best undergraduate paper award on that year for signal processing. Working towards engaging in my Masters in 2026!

I currently work at [Visualiza AI](https://visualiza.ai/) as an Artificial Intelligence developer. My primary focus at this position is to work on Computer Vision algorithms and neural networks, having designed, fine-tuned, and overall trained neural netowkrs for various tasks such as Age and Gender classification, Retail product detection and recognition, Vehicle Axle count for freeway roads, and working on many more.

A little more on my background:
  * I started coding when I was 15, by influence of my brother, and our first project was making a little RPG gameüéÆ!
  * During my early years in college I was part of the Rocket Design Team at USPüöÄ, [Projeto Jupiter](https://www.projetojupiter.com/), as a member of the electronics team.
  * When I was 18 I joined the Navy Academy for OfficersüéñÔ∏è, which didn't last long, but it was an interesting experience!
  * Before commiting to my academic journey I interned at Bank of America Brazilüè¶ at the Fixed Income Sales Desk, which was a great learning and challenging enviroment!
